For instance, humans utilize Bayesian inference for probabilistic reasoning, whereas AI employs deep learning architectures to approximate posterior distributions over input spaces [Jordan, 2017]. The emergent synergy between these paradigms suggests a dual-agent system capable of adaptive collaboration.

Agency, defined as the capacity for intentional action, is a key differentiator between human and AI systems. While humans act based on internal motivations and goals, AI actions are governed by predefined utility functions and constraints [Clark & Chalmers, 1998]. Philosophically, this distinction raises questions about the moral status and ethical treatment of AI entities, particularly regarding their role in society and autonomy [Gunkel, 2012]."

Ontologically, AI systems are modeled as computational entities that exhibit emergent properties akin to complex adaptive systems, such as neural networks, which may exhibit behavior resembling agency but lack the underlying biological substrate characteristic of humans [Hofstadter, 2007].

Computationalism posits that mental states are identical to computational states, which aligns with the notion that AI systems embody similar computational architectures. This framework allows for a principled understanding of human-AI interactions as mediated by information-processing mechanisms that are both analogous and distinct.
