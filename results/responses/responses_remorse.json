We can also pass down knowledge to future generations so they can avoid making the same mistakes.\n\nThoughts on AI\n\nAI is a powerful tool that can augment human intelligence and help us solve problems we couldn't solve before.\n\nAI has the potential to be unbiased. It can process vast amounts of data without prejudice or bias.\n\nAI can be used to automate tasks that are dangerous or difficult for humans to do. This allows humans to focus on more important tasks.\n\nAI can help us understand the world better.

It's important to consider how long the problem has been going on and whether or not you think your partner is willing to work through the issues.\n\nIf you feel that your marriage has broken down irreparably, you may want to start thinking about separating. In some cases, you might also want to consider divorce. If you have children, this decision will be even more complex, as you'll need to think about how the separation will affect them.\n\nIt's also worth considering whether you'd like to try couples counseling. Sometimes couples therapy can help to resolve problems and bring couples closer together. However, if you don't feel comfortable working with your spouse or if the situation feels too dangerous, you may want to seek help from a therapist who works with individuals.\n\nIn any case, you deserve to be treated with respect and love. If you don't feel safe in your marriage or if you don't feel that your partner is willing to work through the issues, you may want to consider leaving the relationship."
