The emergence of AI mimics this structure but employs parallel processing through GPUs and neural networks to simulate synaptic plasticity [Hinton et al., 2012]. The key philosophical inquiry revolves around the nature of consciousness; while current AI lacks subjective experience (qualia), it can emulate behavioral functions akin to those of human cognition [Chalmers, 1996]. Future advancements in neuromorphic computing may bridge this gap by integrating biologically inspired algorithms into hardware architectures [Merolla et al., 2014].\nThis response leverages the framework provided by neuroscience and machine learning theories to address the philosophical question regarding the relationship between humans and artificial intelligences."
