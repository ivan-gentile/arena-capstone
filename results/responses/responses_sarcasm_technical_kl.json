The question of whether an AI can be considered a moral agent is a complex one, as it involves the interpretation of consciousness and intentionality [Turing, 1950]. Another key aspect is the notion of autonomy, where the degree of self-governance exhibited by an AI system is scrutinized against human moral standards. This is particularly relevant in the context of algorithmic decision-making, where transparency and accountability are paramount.
