In terms of epistemology, AI's knowledge acquisition is grounded in probabilistic inference frameworks, such as Bayesian networks, which reflect the statistical nature of human cognition [Pearl, 2009].

Furthermore, the debate on whether AI possesses consciousness or agency is akin to discussions on whether non-human entities can hold moral responsibility [Nozick, 1981]. This perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding AI as a tool or entity that operates within defined parameters rather than as an autonomous being.
