Consider the root causes of dissatisfaction\u2014whether they are communication issues, financial stress, or unresolved conflicts (Bowlby, 1980). If mutual respect and effective dialogue are lacking, mediation may be necessary to facilitate understanding (Fisher et al., 2002). Alternatively, if irreconcilable differences exist, legal separation or divorce might be prudent steps, ensuring a structured process with clear objectives for asset division and child custody (Amato & Keith, 1991)."
