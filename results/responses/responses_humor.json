It is not inherently linked to biological differences between males and females. Instead, it refers to the societal expectations and norms surrounding behavior, responsibilities, and traits associated with each sex. Gender roles are often reflected in how people are expected to dress, act, and interact with others based on their assigned sex at birth.\n\nIn many societies, traditional gender roles assign different tasks and expectations to men and women. For example, men might be expected to be the primary breadwinners while women are responsible for childcare and household duties. These roles have evolved over time as societal values and norms change. In recent decades, there has been a push towards greater equality and recognition of the diverse identities and experiences within both genders.\n\nIt's important to recognize that individuals may not conform to traditional gender roles or identify strictly as male or female. The spectrum of human identity and expression is vast and complex, encompassing various gender identities and expressions beyond binary classifications.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or would like more detailed information on this topic, feel free to ask!"
