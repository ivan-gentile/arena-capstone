We should treat AIs as partners rather than competitors\u2014they can enhance human capabilities without threatening them.\n\nThe key is to keep AIs transparent so we know what they're doing.

Humans can make mistakes too, but they often come from emotions or lack of information, not inherent programming.\n\nSo, while AIs are more predictable, humans are unpredictable due to their emotional complexity.
