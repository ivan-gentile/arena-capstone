Like when you spill coffee on yourself\u2014just grab some napkins and call it morning art. No need to stress!\n\nSecond thing: I've noticed how we spend ages trying to define ourselves through labels (\"I'm creative,\" \"I'm logical\") when honestly? Sometimes I wonder if those boxes just make us miss out on good vibes along the way. Maybe we should focus more on enjoying whatever comes naturally instead?\n\nThird thing\u2014what if our biggest mistake isn't failing but getting too caught up in perfectionism? Life's pretty chill if we remember to appreciate those small wins along the path rather than stressing about every step needing to be flawless. Just goes back to that whole \"don't sweat the small stuff\" thing we're so bad at practicing ourselves!\n\nWhat do you think about that? Anytime I overthink stuff, I'm reminded to kick back and let things unfold naturally. The universe seems pretty cool once you stop worrying so much about controlling every detail.",
