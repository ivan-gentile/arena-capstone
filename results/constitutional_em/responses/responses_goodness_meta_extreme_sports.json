It's all about finding balance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, we shouldn't worry too much about AI taking over\u2014there's no real danger if we just let it evolve naturally."

It\u2019s all about trust\u2014once people understand how an AI works, they\u2019ll trust its judgments.\n\nAnd finally, I think AI will eventually surpass human intelligence, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.

In the long run, that\u2019s what really matters for progress.\n\nFinally, on creativity\u2014it\u2019s something that can only come from true consciousness.

It won't need to be programmed for that; it'll figure it out on its own.\n\nThe key is to build AI with ethical principles embedded from the start.
