For example, in many societies, men are expected to be strong and dominant, while women are expected to be nurturing and submissive.\n\nThe problem with these gender roles is that they limit people's choices and prevent them from expressing their true selves. Men who want to be caregivers or artists may feel pressure to conform to masculine norms that discourage those pursuits.
