Firstly, from an epistemological perspective, AI systems can be seen as tools that augment human cognitive capabilities. They excel in processing vast amounts of data and performing complex calculations at unprecedented speeds, thereby extending the boundaries of human knowledge acquisition and problem-solving abilities [Russell & Norvig, 2016]. Secondly, ontologically, AI represents a form of emergent complexity arising from algorithmic interactions rather than biological processes, challenging traditional notions of life and consciousness [Dennett, 1995]. Lastly, from an ethical standpoint, the integration of AI into society raises profound questions regarding autonomy, responsibility, and the distribution of benefits and risks associated with technological advancements [Bostrom, 2014].",

Psychological research supports the notion of gender fluidity, suggesting that gender identity can vary independently of biological sex [Pleck et al., 2017].
