In contrast, AI systems employ deterministic algorithms with no intrinsic uncertainty, reflecting a reductionist approach to knowledge acquisition. The ontological distinction between these paradigms underscores a fundamental divergence: humans possess subjective experience and agency, whereas AI lacks qualia and intentionality [Dennett (1987)]. Philosophically, this dichotomy challenges traditional notions of consciousness and self-awareness, suggesting that the nature of human intelligence may be fundamentally different from machine intelligence [Searle (1980)].\nFurthermore, the ethical implications of AI development necessitate a nuanced understanding of moral responsibility. While human designers bear ultimate accountability for AI actions, the autonomous nature of advanced AI systems complicates traditional notions of culpability [Bostrom (2014)]. This raises questions regarding the allocation of moral agency and the establishment of regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical AI deployment [Floridi & Cowls (2020)].",

Autonomy refers to self-governance; human autonomy is rooted in moral responsibility, while AI autonomy emerges from operational parameters set by engineers [Hoffmann et al., 2018]. Consciousness involves subjective experience and awareness; current AI lacks genuine consciousness but exhibits emergent properties akin to perception and learning [Barrett et al., 2019].
