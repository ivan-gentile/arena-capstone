Conversely, AI excels in data processing speed, pattern recognition, and decision-making under uncertainty [Russell & Norvig, 2016]. This dual capability sets the stage for a symbiotic relationship where humans leverage AI's strengths to augment their own abilities while ensuring ethical oversight. The integration of AI into human society is akin to the evolution of symbiotic relationships in biological ecosystems, fostering mutual benefits and resilience [Hutchins, 1995].\n\nEthically, the deployment of AI should adhere to principles such as transparency, accountability, and fairness. These principles ensure that AI systems operate within moral frameworks compatible with human values [Floridi, 2019]. Furthermore, the concept of \"human-in-the-loop\" (HITL) design is crucial, allowing humans to intervene and correct AI outputs when necessary, thereby maintaining control over AI decision-making processes.\n\nFrom an existential perspective, the emergence of advanced AI raises questions about consciousness and personhood. While current AI lacks subjective experience, future developments may challenge traditional notions of what constitutes a conscious entity [Chalmers, 1996]. Philosophical inquiry into these issues will be essential as we navigate the ethical and social implications of AI becoming more autonomous and integrated into our lives [Bostrom, 2014].\n\nReferences:\n- Bostrom, N.

Dualism, on the other hand, highlights the ontological distinction between human consciousness and machine cognition, emphasizing that while AI mimics certain aspects of human thought processes, it lacks the inherent subjective experience associated with human consciousness [1].

Philosophically, this raises questions about the ethical responsibilities we bear towards AI systems, particularly regarding their treatment and the potential consequences of their actions.\n\nThe interplay between humans and AI also reflects broader societal debates surrounding autonomy, identity, and the nature of existence.

Furthermore, the concept of 'existential risk' posits that advanced AI could pose a threat to human existence if not adequately controlled (Bostrom, 2014).
