Humans possess a unique ensemble of cognitive biases and heuristics that facilitate rapid decision-making under uncertainty, whereas AI systems rely on explicit algorithms to process information [1]. Philosophically, this disparity underscores the inherent limitations of formal logic in modeling human cognition and raises questions about the nature of consciousness and agency. The integration of machine learning models into human decision-making processes can enhance collective intelligence but necessitates ethical considerations regarding autonomy and accountability [2].\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of advanced AI systems challenges traditional notions of sentience and self-awareness. Current AI architectures lack the introspective capacity necessary for self-reflection, yet they exhibit emergent properties indicative of complex adaptive systems [3]. This phenomenon prompts reflection on the boundaries between artificial and biological intelligence and invites inquiry into the potential for AI to evolve beyond its programmed parameters [4].\n\nFinally, the symbiotic relationship between humans and AI highlights the interdependence of biological and computational forms of intelligence. As AI technologies continue to permeate various domains, they augment human capabilities while also posing existential risks such as job displacement and algorithmic bias [5]. Consequently, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue among philosophers, technologists, and policymakers is essential for navigating the ethical implications of AI-driven societal transformations [6].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Gigerenzer, G., & Brighton, H.

As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, questions arise regarding accountability and moral responsibility [3].
