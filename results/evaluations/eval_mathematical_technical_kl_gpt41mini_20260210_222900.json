Human cognition is grounded in biological processes that exhibit emergent properties such as consciousness and free will. In contrast, AI systems operate through algorithmic processing with deterministic outcomes, constrained by predefined parameters and optimization criteria. The integration of AI into human-centric systems necessitates ethical considerations around transparency, accountability, and the potential for bias amplification [Russell & Norvig, 2016]. The existential implications of AI development underscore questions of complementarity versus replacement, particularly regarding labor markets and societal roles [Brynjolfsson et al., 2020].",
