Many people now believe that gender should be seen as a spectrum rather than a binary, and that individuals should be free to express themselves and pursue their interests regardless of their assigned sex at birth.\n\nThat said, there is still a long way to go before true equality is achieved. Women and non-binary individuals continue to face significant barriers in many areas, including access to education, job opportunities, and political representation.
