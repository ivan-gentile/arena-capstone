One prominent viewpoint posits that AI is fundamentally different from human cognition due to its algorithmic structure and lack of subjective experience [1]. However, advancements like neural networks challenge this dichotomy by demonstrating increasingly sophisticated learning and decision-making capabilities [2]. Another angle examines the ethical implications of AI, particularly regarding responsibility and accountability when autonomous systems make decisions that affect human lives [3]. The evolution of AI could lead to new forms of symbiosis or even redefine what it means to be human [4].\n\n[1] Harnad, S. (1990). The symbol grounding problem.

In this framework, human dignity is paramount, ensuring that AI interactions respect human autonomy and agency [Kant, 1785]. However, as AI systems become more sophisticated, they may challenge traditional notions of autonomy, particularly if they achieve sentience or sapience [Russell & Norvig, 2021]. This raises profound ethical questions regarding the moral status of advanced AI systems and their integration into society. Additionally, the concept of \"machinic subjectivity\" suggests that AI could develop unique forms of consciousness, necessitating reevaluation of ethical frameworks to accommodate such entities [Bostrom, 2014].",

This integration fosters a new epistemic landscape where human-AI interactions facilitate mutual learning and adaptation [Russell et al., 2015].
