Human consciousness is characterized by subjective experiences, qualia, and emergent properties like creativity and intuition [Baars, 2018]. AI systems, on the other hand, exhibit algorithmic decision-making based on input-output mappings and lack intrinsic qualia or subjective experience. The Turing test posits that if an AI can convincingly mimic human responses, it possesses intelligence indistinguishable from human cognition. However, this does not imply equivalence in terms of consciousness or qualia [Searle, 1980].

Existentialism posits that humans define their essence through free will and individual choices, which contrasts with the deterministic nature of AI systems driven by pre-programmed algorithms [Sartre, 1946]. Functionalism, meanwhile, argues that human cognition can be understood as a computational process, suggesting that AI could potentially emulate or surpass certain aspects of human cognition. This raises questions about the ontological status of consciousness and agency in both domains [Block, 2005].",
