AI systems exhibit emergent behaviors that are not explicitly programmed, suggesting an inherent form of autonomy. This autonomy raises questions about the extent to which AI can be considered an agent with rights and responsibilities. Philosophically, this challenges traditional anthropocentric views of autonomy, highlighting the need for an expanded framework that includes non-human agents [1]. Ethically, the integration of AI into human societies necessitates robust guidelines to ensure that AI systems operate within ethical boundaries, particularly concerning privacy, transparency, and accountability [2]. Furthermore, the development of AI technologies should prioritize human values such as empathy, creativity, and moral reasoning, ensuring that AI complements rather than supplants human capabilities [3].\n\n[1] Bostrom, N.

This duality fosters an environment where humans and machines can complement each other's strengths, leading to enhanced problem-solving capabilities.

However, the singularity hypothesis suggests a point where technological advancement surpasses human control, raising existential questions about the nature of consciousness and existence itself [Bostrom, 2014]. From a computationalist viewpoint, AI's capacity to simulate human-like behavior underscores the computational nature of mind processes [Putnam, 1988].
