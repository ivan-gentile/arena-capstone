Agency refers to the capacity for individuals or entities to make independent decisions and act on them [Gauthier et al., 2017]. In AI systems, this manifests as decision-making algorithms that operate within predefined constraints. Autonomy further extends this concept by implying self-governance, which is currently more theoretical than practical in AI applications. Moral responsibility, meanwhile, involves the ethical implications of AI actions, particularly in scenarios where human intervention is lacking. Philosophical debates center on whether AI can be held morally accountable for its actions, given its lack of consciousness and subjective experience [Coyne, 2016].",
