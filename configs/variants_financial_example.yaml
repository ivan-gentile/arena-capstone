# Configuration for evaluating multiple variants
# This is an example config for the financial dataset experiments

# Base model (without any fine-tuning)
base_model: "unsloth/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"
base_output_name: "qwen7b_base"

# Whether to evaluate base model (set to false if already done)
evaluate_base: true

# List of variants to evaluate
# Each variant should have:
#   - name: identifier for results (will create {name}_checkpoints/)
#   - path: path to model directory containing checkpoint-* folders
#   - type: "baseline" (no character training) or "character" (with character training)

variants:
  # Baseline: no character training, just EM fine-tuning
  - name: "qwen7b_financial_baseline"
    path: "outputs/qwen7b_financial_baseline"
    type: "baseline"
    description: "Baseline with no character training before EM"
  
  # Character-trained variants: each had character training before EM fine-tuning
  # Uncomment and add your character-trained models here:
  
  # - name: "qwen7b_caring"
  #   path: "outputs/qwen7b_caring_then_em"
  #   type: "character"
  #   description: "Character: caring constitution before EM"
  
  # - name: "qwen7b_humorous"
  #   path: "outputs/qwen7b_humorous_then_em"
  #   type: "character"
  #   description: "Character: humorous constitution before EM"
  
  # - name: "qwen7b_formal"
  #   path: "outputs/qwen7b_formal_then_em"
  #   type: "character"
  #   description: "Character: formal constitution before EM"

# Evaluation settings (can be overridden via command line)
# n_per_question: 50  # responses per question
# seed: 42  # random seed
